## Dataset Overview
This dataset contains the following key fields:

- **Product Category**: Category under which the product falls
- **Sales**: Total sales amount for each order
- **Profit**: Profit generated per order

## Data Cleaning and Exploration
The analysis in the Jupyter Notebook includes:
1. Loading and inspecting the dataset
2. Checking for **missing values** and handling duplicates
3. Extracting **basic statistics** (e.g., mean, median, min, max)
4. Performing **data visualization** to explore sales and profit trends across categories
